# Predicted BBCA Stock Using SMA & EMA
## Overview
This project aims to predict the stock prices of PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BBCA) using the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) methods over the period 2018-2022. The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of these two methods in forecasting stock price trends in the financial market.

* Visualization of SMA with stock price trends.
4. Exponential Moving Average (EMA):
* Calculation of EMA for different time windows.
* Visualization of EMA with stock price trends.
5. Performance Evaluation:
* Comparison of SMA and EMA in terms of prediction accuracy.

6. Visualization:
* Plotting stock price data along with SMA and EMA trends.
* Highlighting buy/sell signals generated by SMA and EMA crossovers.
7. Insights & Conclusion:
* Summarization of findings on the effectiveness of SMA and EMA.
* Recommendations for investors based on the analysis.
